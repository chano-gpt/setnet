// The build id the bridge is currently serving, observed passively from the `X-setnet-Build` header
// the bridge stamps on every snapshot/pane response (captured in lib/api.ts). Every poll refreshes it
// for free — no extra request. Modelled on the lib/busy.ts store idiom: plain module state + a
// subscribe + a useSyncExternalStore hook, so any call site participates without prop-drilling.
//
// This is the raw feed for two consumers:
//   1. <BuildStamp/> reads the latest value (useServerBuild) to show its "new build — tap to update"
//      nag live, and
//   2. lib/self-update.ts subscribes to drive the no-service-worker auto-reload (with hysteresis).
// Because (2) counts CONSECUTIVE sightings of the same stale id, we notify on EVERY observation —
// repeats included — not only on change; the display hook coalesces unchanged values via React.

// The response header the bridge stamps (bridge/server.ts `BUILD_HEADER`). Kept here so lib/api.ts —
// the only reader — imports one constant rather than hard-coding the string at each fetch site.
